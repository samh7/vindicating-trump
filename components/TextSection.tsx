        This film is a journey to discover the real Donald Trump, and to make
        the case for him as a man and as a leader. It begins with a puzzle. How
        can a man be so intensely loved and hated? Not since Lincoln have we had
        such a divisive figure on the national scene. The film also considers a
        danger that Lincoln warned about—the rise in America of a tyrant like
        Caesar who would promote lawlessness and subvert the foundations of our
        constitutional republic. Is Trump such a man?

        The film shows Trump’s meteoric rise to billionaire status and cultural
        celebrity. Yet even if Trump is a larger than life figure who has the
        dimensions of a Caesar, he never did anything tyrannical. In fact,
        Trump’s term in office reveals that the real lawlessness comes from
        Trump’s adversaries, who will stop at nothing to defeat him. The film
        spells out their tactics, from an invented accusation of treason to
        criminal indictments intended to lock him up for life, and even an
        attempted assassination.

        The story line of the film is to show that Trump’s enemies—the Left and
        the Democrats—are the real Caesar. They are the ones creating
        lawlessness at the highest levels of government. They despise Trump
        because he is the only one who has the power and the will to stop them.
        The film features interviews with Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter in law
        and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Alina Habba,
        Trump’s attorney. It also has an in-depth one-on-one interview with
        Trump himself.

        Throughout the film there are entertaining and powerful re-creations of
        “war rooms”: a media war-room, a war room at the Democratic campaign
        headquarters, and a legal war-room where the criminal plots against
        Trump are hatched. This is Dinesh D’Souza’s most urgent and important
        film. It offers a fresh and eye-opening perspective on the most
        intriguing and controversial figure in America today. It will inform,
        amuse, infuriate, engage and finally motivate Americans of all
        backgrounds.
